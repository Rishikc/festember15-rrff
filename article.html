								<h3>Movies</h3>
								
								<p><strong>We all love magic even though we believe that it does not exist. It is a realm that gives us unprecedented freedom to make-believe, just like dreams. Often, we even lie to ourselves so that our hopes may see light. Don’t tell me you’re still not waiting for that miracle to happen that will give you a superpower just like you have seen in films, because I know you are too. You also know it’s not happening. Who is to blame?</p>
								<p>Is it right to blame our new-age motion movies for this derangement? Face it: most of your fantasies are inspired by video games, superhero movies and Disney/Pixar. I would love to be able to shoot off the ground like Superman or read minds like Professor X (call him a mutant but he’s still fiction) and it surely isn’t so that I can save the town.</p>
								<p>Films were always meant to picturise wonderful stories to woo people and often, derive meanings. That’s exactly what they do today too, only they do it much better. Harry Potter gave us wizardry, LOTR gave us adventure and Prestige gave us surprise, to name a very few (yes, they’re clichéd but I’m not as well-versed as you are). There are truckloads of films out there for every emotion you could want to feel! In that way, films have developed in the right direction and continue to do so. However, it might be too much for us to handle.</p>
								<p>I’m easily charmed by almost any film I watch, but there’s a trap. We are expecting more and more. So, we are getting it. We have size zero women and men with flawless jawlines and kids who can save the world. The make-up industry grows in parallel with the movie one. It’s no new fact that we all want to be as perfect, again in full knowledge that we are being illusioned. THIS, however, is not magic. It ruins us. It contributes nothing to our development as an individual, a society or anything else. Can we not just live in our own magical spheres and watch films without wanting all that we see? Be original within your limits: it is better to distinguish fiction from reality and live with it. Foster creativity. It’s not a process that should stop at you. “We are the average of the five people we spend most of our time with”. Let’s be the creative one for somebody else.</p> 
								
								<h3>Author’s Note:</h3>
								<p> This might be an unusual article: heck, it could be better off as a facebook rant. But I urge you to do the same. Write down what you do not like about a film or a piece of writing or anything whenever you criticise something. Let the creator know his/her shortcomings and not only that he/she underperformed. Creating a film is no small task and feedback is always appreciated. Encourage free thought and creativity. Foster magic </p>
